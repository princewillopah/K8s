## Introduction

Welcome back to Day 36 of our CKA Course! Today, we’re diving deep into **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — the most widely used and powerful authorization mechanism in Kubernetes.

RBAC lets you define **who can do what and where** inside your cluster. This means you can precisely control access to resources, operations, and namespaces, ensuring security without hindering productivity.

To make things practical, we’ll use a user named **Seema** throughout the lecture — and step-by-step, we’ll build her permissions from **namespace-scoped Roles** to **cluster-wide ClusterRoles**.

By the end, you’ll know how to create Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles, and ClusterRoleBindings — the four key RBAC building blocks.

---

## Namespaced vs Cluster-Scoped Resources and RBAC Verbs

Before we start the discussion on RBAC authorization, let me remind you of a few important concepts:

1. **Kubernetes resources can be either namespaced or non-namespaced (cluster-wide).**

   * Namespaced resources exist within a specific namespace (e.g., Pods, Deployments).
   * Non-namespaced resources are cluster-scoped (e.g., Nodes, PersistentVolumes).
   * You can check resource names and whether they are namespaced by running:

     ```bash
     kubectl api-resources
     ```

2. **All Kubernetes resources have verbs (actions) associated with them.**

   * These verbs define what operations can be performed on the resources (e.g., create, delete, get).
   * When we create Roles or ClusterRoles, we use these verbs to specify permissions.
   * To see the available resources along with their verbs, use:

     ```bash
     kubectl api-resources -o wide
     ```

3. **Here is a quick reference table explaining the common verbs you will see in RBAC permissions:**


| Verb               | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create`           | Create a new resource (e.g., `kubectl create deployment nginx`)                   |
| `delete`           | Remove a specific resource (e.g., `kubectl delete pod nginx`)                     |
| `deletecollection` | Remove multiple resources at once (e.g., `kubectl delete pods --all`)             |
| `get`              | Retrieve details of a resource (e.g., `kubectl get pod nginx -o yaml`)            |
| `list`             | List resources of a certain type (e.g., `kubectl get pods`)                       |
| `patch`            | Modify part of an existing resource (e.g., `kubectl patch deployment nginx`)      |
| `update`           | Apply changes to an existing resource (e.g., `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`)  |
| `watch`            | Continuously observe changes in resources (e.g., `kubectl get pods --watch`)      |

## What is RBAC?

Let’s start with the basics.

RBAC stands for **Role-Based Access Control**. It’s a method to regulate access based on a user's role within an organization.

In Kubernetes:

* **Roles**: Define a set of permissions within a **namespace**.
* **RoleBindings**: Associate a **Role *or* ClusterRole** with specific **users**, **groups**, or **service accounts** **within that namespace**.
* **ClusterRoles**: Like roles, but define permissions that can apply **cluster-wide** or be reused across **multiple namespaces**.
* **ClusterRoleBindings**: Bind a **ClusterRole** to **users**, **groups**, or **service accounts** at the **cluster level**, granting access across the entire cluster.

> **Note:** A `RoleBinding` can reference a `ClusterRole`, allowing you to **reuse cluster-defined permissions** in a **specific namespace**. The `ClusterRole`'s rules will only apply **within the namespace** where the `RoleBinding` exists.

RBAC answers these questions:

* Who is the user? (like Seema)
* What resource do they want to access? (pods, deployments, secrets, etc.)
* Which operation do they want to perform? (get, list, create, delete, update)
* Where? (which namespace or cluster-wide)

---

> **Pro Tip:** Don’t just watch — **practice alongside me**. You’ll learn faster and retain more when you actively apply what we cover.

Follow the step-by-step instructions using the resources below:

* [Day 34 GitHub Notes](https://github.com/CloudWithVarJosh/CKA-Certification-Course-2025/tree/main/Day%2034)
* [Day 34 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ9O5JJeq9k&ab_channel=CloudWithVarJosh)

Set up the user, generate the certs, configure `kubeconfig`, and you’ll be ready to test RBAC permissions like a real cluster admin.

---

### Setting Up the `dev` Namespace as Default

In the upcoming examples, we’ll be creating resources in the `dev` namespace. To keep our CLI commands clean and avoid repeatedly typing `-n dev` or `--namespace=dev`, we’ll set `dev` as the **default namespace** for our current context.

Here’s how:

```bash
# Step 1: Create the dev namespace (if not already created)
kubectl create ns dev

# Step 2: Set dev as the default namespace for the current kubeconfig context
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=dev
```

Now, any resource we create or modify will default to the `dev` namespace unless specified otherwise — making our workflow much smoother.

**Note:** You can follow the same process to create `prod` namespace which will be used in the last demo.

---

## Starting with Role and RoleBinding (Namespace-Scoped Permissions)

**Important Limitation: Roles Are Strictly Namespace-Scoped**

Unlike ClusterRoles, **Roles are strictly limited to namespace-scoped resources**.

Here’s why:

* A `Role` **must always be created within a specific namespace**.
* If you don’t explicitly set a namespace, it will default to the `"default"` namespace.
* Therefore, **Roles cannot be used to grant access to cluster-scoped resources** like Nodes, PersistentVolumes, or Namespaces themselves.

For example:

> You **cannot** create a `Role` that allows access to `nodes`, because `nodes` are cluster-scoped. Only a `ClusterRole` can define such permissions.

This limitation makes `Roles` suitable for fine-grained access control **within a single namespace**, but not for managing cluster-wide access.

---

Imagine Seema is a developer working in the `dev` namespace. She needs the ability to **create and list both Pods and Deployments**.

In Kubernetes, such permissions are granted using a **Role** and a **RoleBinding**.

---

### Step 1. Define a Role in the `dev` Namespace

Here’s a YAML manifest for a `Role` that gives access to both Pods and Deployments:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: dev         # This Role is scoped to the 'dev' namespace
  name: workload-editor  # Name of the Role
rules:
# Rule 1: Grant permissions on Pods (which belong to the core API group)
- apiGroups: [""]                         # "" = core API group
  resources: ["pods"]                     # Targeting 'pods' resource
  verbs: ["create", "list"]              # Allow 'create' and 'list' actions

# Rule 2: Grant permissions on Deployments (which belong to the 'apps' API group)
- apiGroups: ["apps"]                    # 'apps' API group contains Deployments, StatefulSets, etc.
  resources: ["deployments"]             # Targeting 'deployments' resource
  verbs: ["create", "list"]              # Allow 'create' and 'list' actions
```

**Key points:**

* You can define **multiple rules** inside a Role. Here, we have two: one for pods and one for deployments.
* `apiGroups: [""]` is for core API group (used for Pods), while `"apps"` is for Deployments.
* This Role is **scoped to the `dev` namespace** — it won’t apply to any other namespace.

---

### Step 2. Bind the Role to Seema (and a Group) using RoleBinding

Now, we need to associate the Role with Seema — and optionally, with a group she belongs to. Kubernetes RoleBindings support **multiple subjects**, including users, groups, and service accounts.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: bind-workload-editor    # Name of the RoleBinding
  namespace: dev                # This RoleBinding is scoped to the 'dev' namespace
subjects:
  # Subject 1: Individual user 'seema'
  - kind: User
    name: seema
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io  # Required for User and Group kinds

  # Subject 2: Group of users (e.g., junior admins)
  - kind: Group
    name: junior-admins
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io  # Group permissions are managed the same way as User

roleRef:
  kind: Role                          # Referencing a Role (not ClusterRole)
  name: workload-editor               # Name of the Role being bound
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io  # Always this value for RBAC roles
```

**Highlights:**

* The `subjects` field is a list — so you can grant access to **multiple users or groups** in one go.
* You can associate the Role with:

  * `User` (like Seema)
  * `Group` (like `junior-admins`)
  * `ServiceAccount` (common for apps or controllers)
* `roleRef` points to the specific Role being granted (`workload-editor` in this case).

**Important Note on ServiceAccounts in RoleBindings**

When you bind a `ServiceAccount` as a subject in a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding:

* The `apiGroup` **must be an empty string** (`""`)
* You **must also specify the namespace** where the ServiceAccount exists

**Example:**

```yaml
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: my-service-account
  namespace: dev
  apiGroup: ""  # MUST be empty for ServiceAccounts
```

This distinction is crucial — using a non-empty `apiGroup` with a ServiceAccount will silently fail and result in no permissions being granted.

---

## What Happens When Seema Runs a Command?

When Seema executes:

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --namespace=dev
```

Here’s what Kubernetes does behind the scenes:

1. **Authentication**: The API server verifies that the user is Seema.
2. **Authorization**: The API server looks for:

   * RoleBindings in the `dev` namespace.
   * Finds `bind-workload-editor` that grants the `workload-editor` Role.
   * Confirms that Seema is listed in the `subjects`.
   * Checks the Role has permission to `create` deployments.
3. **Execution**: If all checks pass, the deployment is created.

---

### Key Pointers:

* **Roles** are used to define **namespaced permissions**, and can have **multiple rules**.
* **RoleBindings** assign those Roles to **users, groups, or service accounts**, and can list **multiple subjects**.
* Use **comments inside YAML** to make your manifests clearer — it helps with collaboration and reviews.
* We used Seema and a group (`junior-admins`) to show how real-world teams might be structured.

---

## ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding (Cluster-Scoped Permissions)

**Important Clarification: ClusterRoles Aren’t Just for Cluster-Scoped Resources**

It’s a common misconception that **ClusterRoles** and **ClusterRoleBindings** are only used for cluster-scoped resources like Nodes or PersistentVolumes.

**In reality**, you can use them to grant access **across all namespaces** for resources that are normally namespace-scoped.

For example:

> Deployments are namespace-scoped resources.
> But if you define a **ClusterRole** that allows actions on Deployments, and bind it using a **ClusterRoleBinding**, then the subject (user, group, or service account) will gain those permissions **in every namespace**.

This is useful when a platform admin or automation service needs consistent access across the entire cluster, without having to create duplicate Roles and RoleBindings in each namespace.

---

Let’s say Seema needs **read access to nodes**. Since nodes are **cluster-level resources**, a namespaced Role won't work. This is where ClusterRoles come in.

---

### Step 1: Define a ClusterRole (`node-reader`)

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1          # API version for RBAC resources
kind: ClusterRole                                 # ClusterRole applies permissions across the whole cluster
metadata:
  name: node-reader                               # Name of the ClusterRole
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]                                  # "" indicates the core API group (e.g., nodes, pods)
  resources: ["nodes"]                             # Targeting the 'nodes' resource (which is cluster-scoped)
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]                  # Allow read-only actions: get one node, list all, or watch for changes
```

---

### Step 2: Bind ClusterRole to Seema using ClusterRoleBinding

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1            # API version for RBAC resources
kind: ClusterRoleBinding                             # Grants cluster-wide access to the subject
metadata:
  name: bind-node-reader                             # Name of the ClusterRoleBinding
subjects:
- kind: User                                          # Type of subject: can be User, Group, or ServiceAccount
  name: seema                                         # Name of the user being granted access
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io                # Always this value for RBAC subjects
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole                                   # Binding to a ClusterRole (not Role)
  name: node-reader                                   # Name of the ClusterRole defined earlier
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io                # Always this value for RBAC role references
```

---

### Bonus Tip: What about ServiceAccounts?

If you’re binding a **ServiceAccount**, remember:

```yaml
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: example-sa
  namespace: dev
  apiGroup: ""  # MUST be empty for ServiceAccount subjects
```

Setting `apiGroup` to anything other than `""` will silently break the binding.

---

## Verify Seema’s Effective Access

Use these commands to check if Seema has the expected permissions:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i create pods --namespace=dev --as=seema
kubectl auth can-i get nodes --as=seema
```

If `yes`, your RBAC setup is working perfectly.

---
## Extra Insight: ClusterRoles Can Be Used in Namespaces Too!


A **ClusterRole** is more versatile than many assume. Here are two key capabilities:

1. **Reusable Across Namespaces:**
   A **ClusterRole** can define permissions for **namespaced resources** (like Deployments or ConfigMaps), not just cluster-scoped ones. A common misconception is that ClusterRoles are only for cluster-wide resources — but that’s not true. You can reference a ClusterRole in a **RoleBinding** within a specific namespace to reuse the same permission set across multiple namespaces without redefining it.

2. **Cluster-Wide Access to Namespaced Resources:**
   When you bind a ClusterRole using a **ClusterRoleBinding**, you can grant access to namespaced resources (like Deployments) **across all namespaces**. This is a powerful pattern when you want a user, group, or service account to manage a particular type of resource cluster-wide, regardless of namespace.


---

### Step 1: Define a ClusterRole (`elevated-workload-editor`)

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: elevated-workload-editor               # Name of the ClusterRole for elevated workload permissions
rules:
  # Rule 1: Manage Pods in the core API group
  - apiGroups: [""]                             # Core API group (no group name)
    resources: ["pods"]                        # Pod resource (namespace-scoped)
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "update"]     # Allowed actions on pods: create, delete, update

  # Rule 2: Manage Deployments in the 'apps' API group
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]                        # Named API group for apps resources
    resources: ["deployments"]                 # Deployment resource (namespace-scoped)
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "update", "patch"]  # Allowed actions on deployments
```

**Explanation:**

* This ClusterRole grants elevated permissions on **pods** and **deployments**, covering common workload management tasks.
* Since it’s a ClusterRole, it can be referenced by:

  * **RoleBindings** inside any namespace to apply these permissions namespace-wise.
  * **ClusterRoleBindings** to grant access cluster-wide (across all namespaces).

---

### Step 2: Bind ClusterRole to a user in a specific namespace (`prod`)

Here’s an enhanced version with detailed inline comments and clear explanation:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: use-clusterrole-in-prod
  namespace: prod                              # RoleBinding applies only within the 'prod' namespace
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole                            # Refers to a ClusterRole (not a Role)
  name: elevated-workload-editor               # The ClusterRole being referenced
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io         # Standard API group for RBAC
subjects:
  # Subject: User 'seema' granted permissions
  - kind: User
    name: seema
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

**Explanation:**

* This RoleBinding is **namespace-scoped** (in `prod`), but it binds to a **ClusterRole** instead of a Role.
* This means Seema gets the permissions defined in `elevated-workload-editor` **only within the `prod` namespace**.
* You can reuse the same ClusterRole in multiple namespaces by creating RoleBindings in each namespace (`staging`, `dev`, `test`, etc.), avoiding permission duplication.

## Quick Recap: RBAC Building Blocks

| Resource             | Scope        | Purpose                                         | Binds to                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Role`               | Namespace    | Define permissions inside a namespace           | Used in a `RoleBinding`                       |
| `RoleBinding`        | Namespace    | Assign Role (or ClusterRole) to subject         | User / Group / ServiceAccount                 |
| `ClusterRole`        | Cluster-wide | Define permissions for all or across namespaces | Used in `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` |
| `ClusterRoleBinding` | Cluster-wide | Assign ClusterRole to subject globally          | User / Group / ServiceAccount                 |

## Real-World Advice & Best Practices

* Always follow the **principle of least privilege** — grant only what is absolutely needed.
* Use **Role + RoleBinding** for namespace-specific permissions.
* Use **ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding** sparingly — only for truly cluster-wide access.
* Prefer binding to **groups** or **service accounts** for scalable, manageable access control.
* When using service accounts, remember that their `apiGroup` must be `""` (empty).
* Reuse **ClusterRoles** with **RoleBindings** in namespaces to avoid duplication.
* Regularly **audit** and **review** your RBAC setup. Use `kubectl auth can-i` to validate access.

---

## Conclusion

RBAC is more than just a checkbox for compliance — it’s your frontline defense in Kubernetes security. Today, we didn’t just define Roles and Bindings, we explored how real permissions map to real users like Seema, across both namespace and cluster scopes.

Remember:

* Use **Role + RoleBinding** for scoped, precise control.
* Use **ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding** carefully — with least privilege in mind.
* Reuse **ClusterRoles** across namespaces with **RoleBindings** to stay DRY.
* Test everything with `kubectl auth can-i` before handing over access.

RBAC isn’t about memorizing YAML — it’s about understanding **intent** and **impact**. The more you practice, the more intuitive it gets. In the next session, we’ll build on this by exploring **Service Accounts** — the primary way workloads interact with the API server.

Keep your clusters secure, and your YAML clean.
